# Papertrail Backend

A Papertrail backend for [Golang logging](https://github.com/op/go-logging) to log to Papertrail app.

The syslog implementation was taken from [remote_syslog2](https://github.com/papertrail/remote_syslog2) because the builtin syslog implementation in Golang does not support Windows.

## Example

```
